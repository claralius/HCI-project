                            Last-hitting involves delivering the killing blow to enemy creeps as doing 
                            so will grant you XP and gold.<br>There are three types of creeps – melee creeps 
                            ranged/caster creeps and siege creeps.<br>Understanding each type of creep is 
                            essential to securing a lot of last-hits.

                            Mini-map gives you an insight into where enemy heroes are and allows you to predict their subsequent movements.
                            <br>
                            Learning how to use the mini-map effectively will help you raise your skill level faster than you can even imagine.
                            <br>
                            The information you’re able to get from the mini-map will impact on your in-game decision making,<br>so you’d do well 
                            to focus on using the mini-map to its full potential.

                <p>
                    In order to perform better in your games, you need to learn the basic positioning of your hero.<br>You need to look at the mini-map more often so you keep  aware of the enemy and farm in the safe zone.<br>Similarly, you need to understand the high-ground advantage  as you will have a vision<br>about what is in front of you and you won’t miss an attack.

                <p>
                    You need to be aware of your enemy all the time.<br>If you are not ready to get into a team fight yet, 
            you must know the basics of retreating.<br>You should be aware of the fact that the enemy team has seen 
            you on the map and<br>escaping is the best option at the moment.

                <h2>PRIORITIZING TOWERS AND ITEMS</h2>
                <p>
                    Object-based gaming is very essential in Dota 2.<br>Taking towers 
            when you win a team fight should be your first priority.<br>Similarly, 
            understanding the item build on each hero is compulsory.<br>Each game brings 
            up a new scenario and under each scenario, different item build works.
                </p>

                <h2>CREEPS AND TOWER AGGRO</h2>
                <p>
                    In a lane or in a team fight, you might have to jump under the enemy tower. 
            <br>In order to avoid the tower from hitting you, learning tower aggro is a very important mechanic.
            <br>Tower aggro could be used in different ways. It can be used for your benefit or for saving yourself. 
            <br>Creeps can also be used to shift the tower to hit them instead of you.

                    Understanding courier mechanics is very important as it may change your hero farming speed. 
            <br>Your courier automatically turns into a flying courier as your hero reaches level 5 in the game. 
            <br>There are options available for the courier boost and invulnerability.
